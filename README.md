# Logistic-Regression-Logistic-Loss
The provided code generates various visualizations related to logistic regression and its associated cost functions. Here's a breakdown of each visualization:

1. **Soup Bowl Visualization:**
     This visualization depicts the soup bowl shape of the logistic cost function. The curvature of the bowl represents the gradual increase in cost as the predicted probability diverges from the true class label.

2. **Simple Example:**
     The simple example plot showcases a basic logistic regression scenario with categorical target values (0 and 1). It illustrates how logistic regression fits a sigmoid curve to the binary classification problem.

3. **Logistic Squared Error:**
     This plot displays the logistic squared error cost function versus the weight and bias parameters. It demonstrates how the cost varies with different combinations of weights and biases.

4. **Two Logistic Loss Curves:**
     The graph shows two logistic loss curves corresponding to two different categorical target values. It visualizes how the logistic loss function behaves differently for each target value.

5. **Logistic Cost Function Comparison:**
     Finally, the comparison plot illustrates the logistic cost function for the given dataset. It highlights the relationship between the input features and the logistic cost, providing insights into the optimization process for logistic regression.

Overall, these visualizations offer valuable insights into the behavior of logistic regression models and their associated cost functions, aiding in model interpretation and optimization.
